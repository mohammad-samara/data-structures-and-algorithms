# Queue with stacks

## Feature Tasks

Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Testing

- It should successfully enqueue items
- It sould successfully dequeue and item
- It should succesfully dequeue all items

## Efficiency: Big O Notation

big O for :

- time O(1)
- space O(1)
