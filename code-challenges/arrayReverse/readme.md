# Reverse an Array

- Used a for loop to play around with the array.

## Challenge

- Write a function that takes an array as an argument, and reverse that array.

## Approach & Efficiency

- I used the `for` loop to loop through the array and another empty array to reverse the original array into it ; then return the new reversed array , whithout using any build in function.
